## Professional Projects

Meta

1. Goals Management
   The Challenge

When I inherited the project, it was effectively orphaned — fully implemented but poorly documented and difficult to maintain. The application had severe performance issues, with load times reaching up to five minutes, and I was simultaneously responsible for handling user escalations and on-call issues.

This was a mission-critical system relied on across the organization, so both stability and speed were non-negotiable.

Phase 1: Stabilization & Immediate Impact

To quickly restore trust in the platform, I:

- Reverse-engineered both the frontend and backend systems
- Implemented lazy loading and pagination on the React + TypeScript frontend
- Added cache warm-up middleware on the backend to reduce cold-start latency
- Added Memcached in front of TAO and saved millions
- These changes reduced load times from ~5 minutes to under 30 seconds, dramatically improving usability and reducing support overhead.

Phase 2: Full Rebuild & Architecture Ownership

After stabilizing the system, I led a complete redesign of both the frontend and backend.
Frontend (React + Flow):

- Built a modular, widget-based architecture
- Enabled customizable dashboards where both users and developers could compose goal-related components
- Emphasized accessibility, performance, and maintainability

Backend:

- Rewritten for scalability and performance
- Optimized APIs and caching strategy
- Reduced load times further to under 5 seconds

2. Data Visualization tool
   Data Consistency Visualization Tool

In addition to the core platform, I built an internal tool for administrators and engineers to monitor stale data between two databases (real-time vs daily sync).

This tool:

- Reduced triage time from hours to minutes
- Improved on-call efficiency
- Allowed engineers to focus on product development instead of debugging data discrepancies

3. Small and Medium Business Group Campaign settings

Built a tool from end-to-end that allowed for users to change campaign information

This tool:

- Simplifies flow of ad campaigns
- Allows for mass changes of a salesperson's campaigns

## Personal

In my free time I enjoy running, working out, and video games. I also love traveling and have visited Hong Kong, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Korea and Japan. I speak English natively, Cantonese fluently and have a basic proficiency in Japanese.

## Misc Information

Flow is a superset of JavaScript much like how TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. They're very interchangeable in usage and anyone that is experienced in Flow is experienced in TypeScript
