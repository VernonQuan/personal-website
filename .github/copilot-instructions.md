<!-- Workspace-specific instructions for GitHub Copilot -->

- This project is a minimal React + Vite starter for a personal website.
- Keep `README.md` up to date with usage and development instructions.
- Prefer edits inside `src/` — `src/App.tsx`, `src/components`, and `src/pages` are the main files to modify.
- The project uses TypeScript, React Router with nested routes, and lazy-loaded pages. Edit `src/pages` to add or change routes and `src/components` to add shared UI.

- Husky + lint-staged are configured for pre-commit linting and formatting; run `npm run prepare` locally after install to enable hooks.
- Tailwind CSS is available (PostCSS + Tailwind). Use utility classes or add tokens to `tailwind.config.cjs`.
- A simple theme toggle component `src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` is included and wired into the layout for quick dark/light themes.
- This project uses Vite 7.x which requires a modern Node.js version; prefer Node.js >= 20.19.0 or 22.12.0+ locally.
